This project is an exploration of the Next.js 13 SSR and CSR full-stack features. It leverages Prisma ORM with the PostgreSQL database, GraphQL to fetch static data, and the Next API for database access. Authentication is handled with Next Auth.

Here are the planned enhancements:

1. Implement data validation on the backend.
2. Enhance the user interface with elements like spinners and more.
